The AI opponent responded with a 7 and cancelled my action, meaning it was my turn again. Then I was unable to do anything. I could select cards to play but not click the play selected or draw card buttons. no action was possible.","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-27T18:57:30.414346+11:00","created_by":"reubenschwarz”\ngit config --global user.email reuben.schwarz@gmail.com”","updated_at":"2026-01-27T21:25:55.103393+11:00","closed_at":"2026-01-27T21:25:55.103393+11:00","close_reason":"Fixed by adding nextTurn call after applySevenDisputeAccept when turnPhase is 'can-end'.
